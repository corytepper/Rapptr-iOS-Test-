
Hello Rapptr ðŸ¦–

Thank you for this fun coding test.

The MenuVC is built with Storyboards.

The LoginVC is built programmatically and the LoginClient uses URLSession.

The ChatVC is built programmatically with a SwiftUI custom cell using AsyncImage. The ChatClient uses the new Async/Await network call.

The AnimationVC is built programmatically and has a fun CoreMotion bonus.

I extracted the buttons and text fields into their own classes as a scaling example.

I also added some custom alerts that are more on brand than the baked in Apple alerts.

I chose not to use a pods/packages on this project, although I would probably use an image caching library compatible with AsyncImage as it does not currently support caching internally.

I was on the fence about implementing MVVM, ultimately deciding not too for simplicity.

I used the variety of techniques to show my skill set and this is not representative of how I would build a client app. Ideally I would use programmatic UI and/or SwiftUI and a generic network manager to handle a variety of network calls.

Thanks for a lovely challenge, Happy New Year!ðŸŽ‡ and I look forward to chatting with you soon ðŸ“².

Best,
